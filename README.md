Face Attendance System – Simple Description
Our Face Attendance System is a smart and contactless way to record attendance using face recognition. Instead of using ID cards or signing registers, the system uses a webcam to recognize a person’s face and automatically marks their attendance with the time and date.

We built this system using Python, OpenCV, and a lightweight Flask web app. It uses a face recognition technique called LBPH (Local Binary Pattern Histogram), which works well even if there are changes in lighting or facial expressions.

The user just needs to sit in front of the camera, and the system will do the rest – detect the face, recognize it, and mark attendance. All records are saved securely in a database or file.

This system helps reduce manual work, prevents fake attendance, and makes the whole process faster, easier, and more accurate.
